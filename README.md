# Majima
Kiryu-CHAN! 

I always wanted to make a Majima skin, but there wasn't a character that really fits him. 
So huge thanks to tsuyoikenko for creating the interrogator, got inspired the moment I saw his abilities (Also thanks for having an easy armature to work with lol).

I replaced the Cleaver with Majima's knife.

Enjoy!
